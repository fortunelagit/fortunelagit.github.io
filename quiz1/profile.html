                      <p class="text-left">Hello, my name is Khaela Fortunela~ </br>
                      I am third year student of Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology.</br>
                      This website is made for an important assignment of mine in Web Development Class.</br></br>
                      Okay, now is the time to move on and start telling about myself.</br>
                      Actually, this feels a little like the making of CV, so I intent to make it as informal as possible.</br>
                      I was born in May. As for the date, forget it. You only need to know that I'm a Taurus.</br>
                      My hometown is in Kediri. Haha, not the city, but the regency. I live in the mountainous areas of Wilis Mountain. 
                      Alright, I'll tell you more about it in my other post about My Hometown.</br></br>
                      Maybe.. I should talk about my education now. Since I want it to be informal, let's start with kindergarten.</br>
                      The kindergarten I went to was called TK Dharma Wanita Pagung. As for location, forget it, even if I tell you, you wouldn't know.
                      Just remember it's somewhere nearby to my house.</br>
                      As for primary school, I went to SDN Pagung 2. The

              </div>
              <p class="text-left">location is hmm, somewhere in the mountain.</br>
                Next up, for middle school, I went quite far. The name is SMPN 1 Kediri. It's at the other side of Brantas River.</br>
                And lastly, for high school, I went to SMAN 2 Kediri, also known as SMADA. The location is well, somewhere in Veteran Street.</br>
                Well, I think that's all you need to know about me. See you in my next post!</br></br></br>
